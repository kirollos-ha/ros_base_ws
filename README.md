# ros base workspace
this is a minimal ros noetic workspace for when you gotta run this thing and have no small workspace at hand to just run

it's basically the hello world publisher subscriber tutorial, but wihtout the kilometric comments

might as well put it here so I don't need to do this again if I need it again, because I know I'm gonna need it again
